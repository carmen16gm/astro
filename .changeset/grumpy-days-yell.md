Removes support for astroFlavoredMarkdown

In 1.0 Astro moved the old Astro Flavored Markdown (also sometimes called Components in Markdown) to a legacy feature. This change removes the `legacy.astroFlavoredMarkdown` option completely.

In 2.0 this feature will not be available in Astro at all. We recommend migration to MDX for those were still using this feature in 1.x.
