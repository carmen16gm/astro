When a project uses the new `build.excludeMiddleware` Astro config option, the `@astrojs/netlify/functions` adapter will bundle your middleware to run in a [Netlify Edge Function](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/).

See the [Netlify adapter documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/#run-middleware-in-edge-functions) for more details.
