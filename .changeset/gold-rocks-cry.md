Add a new experimental flag (`experimental.assets`) to enable our new core Assets story.

This unlocks a few features:
- A new built-in image component and JavaScript API to transform and optimize images.
- Relative images with automatic optimization in Markdown.
- Support for validating assets using content collections.
- and more!

See [Assets (Experimental)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/) on our docs site for more information on how to use this feature!
