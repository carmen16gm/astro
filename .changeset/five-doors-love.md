Adds support for using AVIF (`.avif`) files with the Image component. Importing an AVIF file will now correctly return the same object shape as other image file types. See the [Image docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#update-existing-img-tags) for more information on the different properties available on the returned object.
